# Reduction Method

This file defines `ReductionMethod`, which packages the purely algebraic part of
problem reduction on matrices indexed by general row and column types.

`ReductionMethod`

*   `ι`, `κ`, `R`: the index types of the original matrix and the ring type.
*   `ιs`, `κs`: the index types of the sliced subproblem matrix.
*   `IsSliceable`: describes when a `Matrix ι κ R` can be sliced.
*   `slice`: extracts a subproblem of type `Matrix ιs κs R` from a sliceable matrix.
*   `reconstruct`: reconstructs a full matrix from the original matrix context
    and a solution to the submatrix.
*   `reconstruct_slice_eq`: proves the algebraic consistency of `reconstruct` and `slice`.

  /-- The “slice” operator, extracting a smaller subproblem from a sliceable matrix. -/
  slice : (A : Matrix ι κ R) → (hA : IsSliceable A) → Matrix ιs κs R

  The reconstruct function assembles a full matrix from the original matrix
  context and a submatrix solution.

                (slice_sol : Matrix ιs κs R) → Matrix ι κ R

  Correctness of reconstruction: reconstructing with the original slice yields
  the original matrix.
